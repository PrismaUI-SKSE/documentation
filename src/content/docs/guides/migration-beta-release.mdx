This guide covers the breaking changes when migrating from PrismaUI 0.2.0-beta to 1.0.0.

## Breaking Changes

1. **String Type Migration**<br/>
  We migrated from `std::string` types to `const char*` for better API stability.

2. **PrismaView Type Change**<br/>
  `PrismaView` type is now `uint64_t` instead of `std::string` for better API stability.
