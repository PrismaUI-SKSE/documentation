### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking Changes**

1. **API Method Signatures** - All method signatures have changed due to the native C types migration
2. **Include Headers** - Update your include statements to use the new API headers
3. **Data Types** - Replace std library types with native C equivalents
4. **Method Calls** - Update existing `Invoke` calls to handle the new encoding system
