- **WebKit** version is `615.1.18.100.1`.
- Supports **ES2022** and below JavaScript features.
- `Video` is not supported. Use `GIF` images instead.
- `Audio` is not supported. Play sounds from SKSE.
- `WebGL` is not supported.
- UI refresh rate has **60 FPS** cap for now.
- **CPU** rendering is only available for now.
- JS event `contextmenu` doesn't work. Use this implementation instead:
  ```ts
  window.addEventListener('mousedown', function (event) {
    if (event.button === 2) {
      // right-click
      const contextMenuEvent = new MouseEvent('contextmenu', {
        ...event,
        view: window,
        bubbles: true,
        cancelable: true,
        screenX: event.pageX,
        screenY: event.pageY,
        clientX: event.pageX,
        clientY: event.pageY,
      });

      event.target?.dispatchEvent(contextMenuEvent);
    }
  });
  ```
