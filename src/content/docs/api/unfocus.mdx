## Overview

Removes input focus from the specified `PrismaView` and hides the cursor. This method deactivates the UI and returns control to the game, automatically resuming the game if it was previously paused by the `Focus` method.

<Aside type="tip" title="Automatic Game Resume">
When you call `Unfocus`, the game will automatically resume if it was paused by a previous `Focus` call with `pauseGame = true`.
</Aside>

## Syntax

```cpp
void Unfocus(PrismaView view);
```

## Parameters

### `view` (required)
- **Type:** `PrismaView`
- **Description:** The `PrismaView` from which to remove focus

## Return Value

This method returns `void`.

## Usage Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic Unfocus">

```cpp
// Simple unfocus operation
PrismaUI->Unfocus(view);
logger::info("View unfocused - control returned to game");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="Clean State Management">
Always unfocus views when closing menus or dialogs to ensure proper game state management and prevent input conflicts.
</Aside>

- **Paired Operations:** Always pair `Focus` and `Unfocus` calls appropriately
- **Input Management:** Use `Unfocus` to return game input control to the player

## Common Issues

<Aside type="caution" title="Troubleshooting">
If unfocus behavior seems incorrect:
- Ensure the `PrismaView` is valid and currently focused
- Check that your UI properly handles the focus state change
- Verify that game input is being restored correctly after unfocus
- Make sure no other views are interfering with focus management
