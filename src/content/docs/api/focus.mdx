import { Aside, Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

Sets input focus to the specified `PrismaView` and shows the cursor. This method activates the UI for user interaction and optionally pauses the game to provide an uninterrupted interface experience.

<Aside type="caution" title="Game State Management">
When using the `pauseGame` parameter, ensure your plugin properly handles game pause/resume states to maintain a smooth user experience.
</Aside>

## Syntax

```cpp
bool Focus(PrismaView view, bool pauseGame = false);
```

## Parameters

### `view` (required)
- **Type:** `PrismaView`
- **Description:** The `PrismaView` to receive focus

### `pauseGame` (optional)
- **Type:** `bool`
- **Default:** `false`
- **Description:** Optional parameter to pause the game when focus is active

## Return Value

- **Type:** `bool`
- **Returns:** `true` if focus was successfully set; otherwise, `false`

## Usage Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic Focus">

```cpp
// Simple focus without pausing the game
bool success = PrismaUI->Focus(view);
if (success) {
    logger::info("View focused successfully");
} else {
    logger::error("Failed to focus view");
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Focus with Game Pause">

```cpp
// Focus the view and pause the game
bool success = PrismaUI->Focus(view, true);
if (success) {
    logger::info("View focused and game paused");
    // UI is now active and game is paused
} else {
    logger::error("Failed to focus view");
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="User Experience">
Always provide visual feedback when focus changes occur. Consider showing/hiding UI elements or changing cursor appearance to indicate the current focus state.
</Aside>

- **Game Pause Management:** Use `pauseGame = true` for menus that require full user attention
- **Focus Pairing:** Always pair `Focus` calls with corresponding `Unfocus` calls

## Common Issues

<Aside type="caution" title="Troubleshooting">
If focus isn't working properly:
- Ensure the `PrismaView` is valid and not destroyed
- Check that no other views are blocking focus
- Verify the view's DOM is fully loaded before focusing
- Make sure you're handling the return value appropriately
