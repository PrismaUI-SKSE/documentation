import { Aside, Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note" title="Availability">
Available since **1.1.0-rc** version.

## Overview

Checks if the specified `PrismaView` is currently hidden. This method allows you to query a view's visibility state, which is useful for conditional UI logic and state management.

<Aside type="tip" title="Visibility State Check">
Use this method to check visibility before performing operations that depend on whether a view is visible or hidden, such as toggling visibility or conditional rendering logic.
</Aside>

## Syntax

```cpp
bool IsHidden(PrismaView view);
```

## Parameters

### `view` (required)
- **Type:** `PrismaView`
- **Description:** The `PrismaView` to check for hidden state

## Return Value

- **Type:** `bool`
- **Returns:** `true` if the view is hidden (or not found), `false` if the view is visible

## Usage Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic Usage">

```cpp
// Check if view is hidden
if (PrismaUI->IsHidden(view)) {
    SKSE::log::info("View is hidden");
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Behavior Details

- Returns `true` if the view's `isHidden` flag is set to `true`
- Returns `false` if the view is visible
- Returns `true` if the view is not found (with a warning logged)

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="Defensive Programming">
Always check visibility state before performing visibility-dependent operations to avoid unnecessary calls and ensure correct UI behavior.
</Aside>

- **State Validation:** Check visibility before show/hide operations
- **Conditional Logic:** Use for UI state-dependent behavior
- **Toggle Operations:** Essential for implementing toggle functionality
- **Error Handling:** Check for `true` return with invalid views

## Common Issues

<Aside type="caution" title="Troubleshooting">
If `IsHidden` returns unexpected results:
- Verify the view is valid using `IsValid`
- Check that the view hasn't been destroyed
- Remember that `IsHidden` returns `true` for invalid/not found views
- Look for warning messages in the log
- Ensure you're checking the correct view instance
