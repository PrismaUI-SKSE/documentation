## Overview

Checks if a `PrismaView` instance is valid. This method is essential for ensuring that a view has not been destroyed before attempting to perform operations on it, preventing crashes and undefined behavior.

<Aside type="caution" title="Safety Check">
Always use `IsValid` before performing operations on a `PrismaView` that might have been destroyed or invalidated, especially in asynchronous or event-driven code.
</Aside>

## Syntax

```cpp
bool IsValid(PrismaView view);
```

## Parameters

### `view` (required)
- **Type:** `PrismaView`
- **Description:** The `PrismaView` to check for validity

## Return Value

- **Type:** `bool`
- **Returns:** `true` if the `PrismaView` is valid (e.g., it has not been destroyed); otherwise, `false`

## Usage Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic Validity Check">

```cpp
// Simple validity check before operation
if (PrismaUI->IsValid(view)) {
    PrismaUI->Invoke(view, "updateUI()");
    logger::info("View is valid - operation performed");
} else {
    logger::warn("View is invalid - operation skipped");
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="Defensive Programming">
Use `IsValid` checks as a defensive programming practice, especially in complex applications where view lifecycle management might be distributed across multiple systems.
</Aside>

- **Pre-Operation Checks:** Always validate views before performing operations
- **Error Handling:** Provide appropriate error handling for invalid views
- **Lifecycle Tracking:** Use validity checks to track view lifecycle states
- **Debugging Aid:** Use validity checks to identify view management issues
