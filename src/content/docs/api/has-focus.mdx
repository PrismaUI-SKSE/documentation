## Overview

Checks if the specified `PrismaView` has input focus. This method is useful for determining whether the UI is currently receiving user input, which can help manage game state and input handling.

<Aside type="tip" title="Focus Management">
Use this method in combination with `Focus` and `Unfocus` to create sophisticated input management systems that respond to user interaction patterns.

bool HasFocus(PrismaView view);
