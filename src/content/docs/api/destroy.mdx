## Overview

Completely removes a `PrismaView` from memory and unfocuses it. This method performs a complete cleanup of the view, freeing all associated resources and ensuring proper memory management.

<Aside type="caution" title="Irreversible Operation">
`Destroy` is an irreversible operation. Once a view is destroyed, it cannot be used again and you must create a new view if needed.
</Aside>

## Syntax

```cpp
void Destroy(PrismaView view);
```

## Parameters

### `view` (required)
- **Type:** `PrismaView`
- **Description:** The `PrismaView` to remove from memory

## Return Value

This method returns `void`.

## Usage Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic View Destruction">

```cpp
// Simple view destruction
PrismaUI->Destroy(view);
SKSE::log::info("View destroyed and memory freed");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="Memory Management">
Always destroy views when your plugin shuts down or when views are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks and ensure clean resource management.
</Aside>

- **Cleanup on Exit:** Always destroy views during plugin shutdown
- **Validity Check:** Use `IsValid` before destroying to avoid unnecessary operations
- **Resource Management:** Destroy views when they're no longer needed to free memory
