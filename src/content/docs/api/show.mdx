<Aside type="note" title="Availability">
Available since **1.1.0** version.

## Overview

Makes a hidden `PrismaView` visible. This method sets the view's visibility flag to allow it to be rendered in the next frame, enabling you to show previously hidden UI elements without recreating them.

<Aside type="tip" title="Efficient UI Management">
Use `Show` and `Hide` to toggle UI visibility instead of destroying and recreating views. This approach is more efficient and preserves the view's state.
</Aside>

## Syntax

```cpp
void Show(PrismaView view);
```

## Parameters

### `view` (required)
- **Type:** `PrismaView`
- **Description:** The `PrismaView` to make visible

## Return Value

This method returns `void`.

## Usage Examples

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Basic Usage">

```cpp
// Show a previously hidden view
PrismaUI->Show(view);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Behavior Details

<Aside type="caution" title="Operation Queue">
If the view is already visible, the operation is ignored with a debug log message.
</Aside>

- Sets the `isHidden` flag to `false`
- View begins rendering in the next frame
- If view is already visible, operation is silently ignored
- Does not affect focus state - use `Focus` separately if needed

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="State Management">
Combine `Show` with `Focus` when you want to both display and activate a view for user interaction. Use `Show` alone when you want to display a view without capturing input.
</Aside>

- **Pair with Hide:** Use `Show` and `Hide` as complementary operations
- **Check State:** Use `IsHidden` to check visibility before showing
- **Focus Management:** Call `Focus` separately if input interaction is needed
- **Performance:** Prefer show/hide over destroy/create for temporary UI

## Common Issues

<Aside type="caution" title="Troubleshooting">
If a view doesn't appear after calling `Show`:
- Verify the view is valid using `IsValid`
- Check that the view's z-order isn't behind other views
- Ensure the view's HTML content is properly loaded
- Verify no other views are blocking it
- Check that the view was previously hidden, not destroyed
